# Antarcticom Alpha v0.1.0

🚀 **First Public Alpha Release**

This is the very first build of Antarcticom! It's an early technology preview to demonstrate the core functionality and performance of our new native Flutter + Rust architecture.

## What works:
*   ✅ **Real-time Chat**: Messaging is fully functional and instant.
*   ✅ **Authentication**: User registration and login.
*   ✅ **Basic UI**: The new visual design, including themed backgrounds (Stars, Sun, Moon, Field).
*   ✅ **Cross-Platform**: Windows and Web builds are available (Android coming soon).

## ⚠️ Important Notes:
*   **This is pre-alpha software.** Expect bugs, missing features, and potential UI glitches.
*   **Voice Chat**: Not yet fully integrated in this client build.
*   **Security**: End-to-end encryption is implemented in the core but currently disabled for testing purposes.

## How to Run:
**Windows:**
1.  Download the `windows-release.zip`.
2.  Extract the **entire folder**.
3.  Run `antarcticom.exe`.
*(Note: If Windows Defender warns you, it's because this is an unsigned developer build. Click "More info" -> "Run anyway".)*
